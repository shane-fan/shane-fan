### About Me
Hi, I'm Shane. I'm a senior at UC Berkeley, class of 2021.

I'm currently 17 years old, and I have three associates degrees! I really like coding and pursue it as a hobby. In my free time, I rock climb, play the piano, and work on random projects :p

My current interests include cloud computing, 19th century English lit, and blockchain!
